---------------------------------------------------------------------
For the past three months, I have been working in [[https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service][PKS]] observability features. Right now, it's mostly about kubernetes logging feature.

hmm, logging? Collect logs, and send them to log endpoint. That looks quite straightforward. Simple and common, isn't it? Agree, but only partially. Noticed some challenges and differences in the container logging, compared to VM or bare metal envs.

Here are the summary. Check it out! And see how much it may apply to your kubernetes project(s).

Normally log transport workflow is like below:

Then you might have heard of commercial product like splunk, or open source solution like ELK or EFK. So you might think problem is solved. *Not Yet, My Friends*.

[[color:#c7254e][Running service in containers are different from running in VM or bare metal]].

Process is more ephemeral; deployment is more distributed. Consequently it makes container log collecting quite different.

*Challenge I: Fail to collect all the critical log*

- Pods get recreated within 5 seconds
- Not all logs are redirected to stdout/stderr
- When pod crash or recreated, we lose the log

  Yes, they are doing it in a different way.

  Instead of one static log folder path of fluent-bit/fluentd, they are registering to k8s Pod events.

  So they should get logs more promptly, especially when Pods are only alive for less than 1 minutes.

** *Challenge II: Logging security and segregation*
- Namespace multi-tenancy
- Secure infra level logging
- Security threats from layered log visualizations
- syslog endpoint protection
*** Skip pods per namespace                                        :noexport:

@XXX, fluent-bit will still scan logs from pods of "disabled" namespaces. Just fb filter will drop the messages.

So if that namespace keeps logging crazily, the expected performance improvement from disabling that namespace log draining won't happen.

Right? (edited)


XXX [3 hours ago]
Ah, I see what you are talking about now.


XXX [3 hours ago]
This would be something we need to measure to see how bad a performance impact it is. We may move away from hitting disk entirely in the future so I'd hate to invest a lot of time into mitigating this. Do you mind creating a story in the icebox and let XXX know so he is aware?


Denny Zhang [1 hour ago]
Sure. Will do

Yeah, I start this conversation mostly for discussions.  Not intentions to change anything at current stage

We could limit the `[INPUT]` to only the files for containers in our namespace. But that might be a bit involved. Controller would have to do more work and roll the daemonset more often when containers get created or destroyed in the monitored 

- High latency of log collecting
** *Challenge III: Hard to achieve performance SLA*
- Noisy neighborhood
- Single instance of log collector
- Too many Pods in one K8S worker VM
- Back-pressure
- Slow disk create significant latencies for log agent
** *Challenge IV: Logging for different use cases*
- k8s addon, control panel, infra level
- layered problems

What is PKS? [[https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service][PKS]] is an enterprise Kubernetes solution from VMware and Pivotal.

Interested in PKS job opportunities? Here is [[https://vmware.rolepoint.com/?shorturl=qeEMe][my referral link]]. Open it, then search with "PKS". You will see all openings. Leave me a message, if you're applying positions for Palo Alto Office specifically.

In this presentation, we will share our learnings about
enterprise logging for microservices architecture. We will highlight
key reliability and security features that large enterprise dev teams
require when implementing microservices architectures. We will discuss
the current state of microservices logging, the new challenges it
poses for large enterprise dev teams and then we will follow up with
suggestions on how to address these challenges with a quick demo in
the end.
