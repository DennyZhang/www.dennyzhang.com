Today is the last day of 2017. And I will be turning to my 35 in 2018. I can't believe it.

Here comes my yearly review for 2017. What about yours?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Achievements:
1. Doing pretty well in *LinkedIn Engagement*. Initiated and involved in many interesting discussions and [[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6339325111232974848][talented friends]]. Thanks!
- Know how to learn and share *publicly*; and grow tech influence in an *organic* way. e.g, do daily today-review in Slack, subject study in [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/battle][GitHub]].
- Started to *admit my weakness*, and live with it. Yes, I'm not smart. And I don't remember details that well. That's fine. It's me. It's who I am.
- Forming the habit of *reading books*. Even if reading for nothing, it gives me peace inside. Roughly ~5 hours per week. Not bad, isn't it?
  
Opportunities:
1. Need to publish *more* and *useful* blog posts. In 2017, I only published ~1 post per month.
2. *Try* new things as many as possible. [[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradipta-dash-a4091127/][Pradipta Dash]] inspires me a lot.
3. *Meet* more talented friends physically or in google hangout. Glad to build a strong connection with [[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mcallister-3789205/][Jonathan McAllister]]. He is a brave fighter by-heart.

Life:
1. Pay more attention to my health. Do 50 press-up at least. Jogging for 30 minutes per day. Let's start from this.
- Spend more quality time with my parent and relatives. Unfortunately my father got a cancer this year. He is doing much better now. I definitely need to engage more in our family events.
- Be prepared to be a good father. We're expecting to have a baby. Both my wife and I have a very busy professional job. It would be a tough journey. Hope we both can enjoy it.

** [#A] Blog fact                                        :noexport:Important:
- email list: For a beginner, a good rule of thumb is one dollar per subscriber per month.
- a sidebar offer only converts 0.5% of new visitors to subscribers.
- Feature Box may convert 5% of new visitors to subscribers.
- Blacklinks should be over 250+: [[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/everythingsysadmin.com][Sample]].

*** TODO Pricing and Revenue facts
*** When a self-published author sells an ebook for $4.99, they make $3.25.

Self-publishing will continue to grow because the economic model is so
much better for authors. When a self-published author sells an ebook
for $4.99, they make $3.25. When a traditionally published author
sells an ebook for the same price, they make $1.25. Now that the
technology exists to give self-published authors the same access to
the market as traditionally published authors, there's little
incentive to go with traditional publishing, except for the few
markets that are still channel driven, such as children's books and
middle-grade novels.
