---------------------------------------------------------------------
There are tons of tools for DevOps work. Like Chef, puppet, Jenkins, Docker, Vagrant, etc. Definitely an endless list!

Here we only talk about tools for personal use. They shall *dramatically improve our productivity*, as DevOps professionals. Below are my favorite ones. Let me know yours!

- *Comfortable laptop*. I live happily with mac air 13-inch [1] + Linode. This mac air only costs me about $1100, and the battery lasts for 6-8 hours. One mistake I shall admit. It only has 128 GB SSD. I should buy 256GB!

Working in a moving environment, I do most of my work in the cloud. With a monthly payment of $10 in [[https://www.linode.com/?r=e4825280de70fda18185c3cce1b92ca868bc5759][Linode]], I get a reliable VM with 2GB RAM. Also a public IP, which is tremendously helpful for trouble shooting. (Tips: export your laptop to the Internet easily like [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/export_mac_laptop][this]]).

Note: previously I was using DigitalOcean, now I've switched to Linode. Here is [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/vps_linode][why]].

- *Local knowledgebase*. In daily DevOps work, we may run into same issues quite often. *Emacs Org-mode* is the King to build up a powerful local KnowledgeBase. I spend almost 2 months learning how to use it. Yes, 2 months! To use Org-mode, we have to get familiar with [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/mytest][emacs]] first. It's not a pleasant experience, or I shall say struggling. However I'm very proud to say it's [[color:#c7254e][the most important skill]] I have learned in my whole life.

Can you believe that? *Every sentence of this blog is created and updated via emacs org-mode*. Now I can share anything I've learned in a user-friendly format. And I only takes less than *5 seconds*!

- *Safe and automatic backup*. Always be prepared for your computer crash at a bad time. I use *Dropbox + Local git repo*. I keep my core data as minimum as possible. Currently it's only 400MB, which includes almost everything I've learned in the past 10 years! Then I create a local git repo for this, which gives me version support.

Any unrecoverable data is protected by Dropbox. My total size is 3GB.

- *Quick test*. Previously I use Vagrant a lot for local test, now I switch to *Docker*. Guess you're the same, right?

- *Draw diagrams*. I want to be professional in documentation. Omnigraffle [2] is quite efficient to draw various diagrams. You may notice that in multiple blog posts. [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/demo_jenkins][example1]], [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/process_foreground][exmaple2]].

Yes, it costs almost $100. But it saves a lot of troubles and it's way better than tools like Microsoft Visio.[3]
- *Easy and fast monitoring*. For any critical envs, I will setup an external monitoring by *Uptimerobot.com*.[4]

[[image-blog:Favorite Applications For My DevOps Work][https://www.dennyzhang.com/wp-content/uploads/denny/uptimerobot.png]]

It's totally free. And I use it for http url and tcp port check.
- *WebOps and Integration*. Here I choose *Jenkins*.

Routine tasks in my daily life will be wrapped up as Jenkins jobs. The GUI operation is usually easier and help me to track the running history.

- *Personal Email account*. If you're doing any consultant work, I would suggest you use emails with your own domain. Currently I'm actively using *@dennyzhang.com to communicate with my clients or sales leads.

Try ZOHO mail.[5] We can create 25 mail accounts for free! It's pretty reliable, according to my experience.
