DigitalOcean is inexpensive to AWS EC2. Surprisingly *Linode is even 30%-40% cheaper than Digtialocean*. Certainly Linode is much less matured to them both. But with reasonable compromise, Linode could be attracting to small business and individuals.

Enclosed is a detail VPS comparison report, based on my hand-on experience.

[[image-blog:VPS Comparison: Linode VS DigitalOcean][https://www.dennyzhang.com/wp-content/uploads/denny/linode_vps.png]]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice: If you find this post useful, and decide to try *Linode*. Please kindly use [[https://www.linode.com/?r=e4825280de70fda18185c3cce1b92ca868bc5759][my Linode referral link]].

Personally I have migrated my blog to Linode for 3 months. The overall experience is good. Since security model of Linode is pretty primitive, I highly recommend you to enforce this: [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/linux_security][9 Useful Tips For Linux Server Security.]]

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning: This comparison was done on Sep 2016. There might be *dramatic changes* as time going. For example, Linode has significantly lowered its price May 2016.

We evaluate different VPS providers, in terms of Stability and Economy. Definitely try to keep *TCO* (total cost of ownership) as mininum as possible.

To be short, I will use [[https://www.linode.com/?r=e4825280de70fda18185c3cce1b92ca868bc5759][Linode]] for non critical envs, [[https://m.do.co/t/dab249326995][DigitalOcean]] for critical envs.
- DigitalOcean (DO) is much more advanced and stable for critical envs.
- Linode(LN) is 30%-40% cheaper with similar machine flavor of DO. Certainly pricing is only one factor. But it really make a difference for SMB or non-critical test envs. If the consequence is good enough.
- I've hosted a medium-hot wordpress website for 3 weeks in LN. So far no direct issues related to platform itself.
** Linode VS DigitalOcean For Pricing
- With the same cost, *LN provides 200% memory and CPU*, compared to DO. For example, with 0.06/hr, LN provides VM with Linode8192(8GB memory 4 CPU cores); With 0.06/hr, DO provides VMs with 4GB memory 2 CPU cores.

- Linode gives more bandwidth with the same cost.

LN Pricing on Sep, 2016:

DO Pricing on Sep, 2016:

** Linode VS DigitalOcean For Usability
- LN GUI is a bit ugly and not user-friendly.
- To start a desired VM, LN takes another 3~5 button clicks.
- Compared to AWS and DO, LN is missing lots of advanced features.[1]
** Linode VS DigitalOcean For Stability
Though LN provide same SLA(99.99%[2]) as DO, it's far less stable and insecure:
- LN suffers much more DDoS attack
- LN has more disk storage issues
- Infrastructure security is less guaranteed. e.g, it lead people to ssh with root password by default.

If Linode is a good fit for you, [[https://www.linode.com/?r=e4825280de70fda18185c3cce1b92ca868bc5759][register in linode]] and give it a try. Frankly speaking, for critical envs in cloud, I will stick to [[https://m.do.co/t/dab249326995][DigitalOcean]] or even AWS EC2.
