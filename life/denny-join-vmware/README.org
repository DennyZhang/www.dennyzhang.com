Guys, [[Color:#c7254e][Two Big News]] to share with you!!

My wife and I have relocated to silicon valley. Finally! I will join VMware as a staff engineer next Monday. Work on enterprise-ready kubernetes product([[url-external:https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service][PKS]])

Hope I can make good influence and big contributions to the team and the product very soon.

Apparently I need to thank my wife and my family. It's a big move. California is expensive and challenging. No kidding!

Also I'd like to thank my current employer - [[url-external:http://www.totvslabs.com/][TOTVSLabs]]. 

[[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/in/goetten][Vicente Goetten]], [[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/in/kung-wang-77a7089][Kung Wang]] and the team. Many thanks! 

A lot of trust and freedom for me. I had a lot of fun working here. Global culture with a Brazilian sauce. People are warm and direct. Most of my working experience in US is from TOTVSLabs. I learned a lot from the team. 

If you're interested, check their openings: [[url-external:https://totvslabs.recruiterbox.com/][here]]. (Mostly allow remote)

Looking ahead. Why I'm so determined to join VMware?

It fits my next career goal very well. Be a [[color:#c7254e][k8s expert]]; Be a qualified [[color:#c7254e][cloud architect]] in the near future.

Definitely a lot of things to learn. And a lot of mistakes to make, I guess. But I'm ready!

Our office is in Palo Alto. If you're nearby, ping me in [[url-external:https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennyzhang001][LinkedIn]] or [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/slack][Slack]]. Let's grab a coffee! 

If you're not local, it's fine as well. When you have questions related to DevOps, Kurbernets or even VMware [[url-external:https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service][PKS]], remember to contact me. I'm just one button away.
