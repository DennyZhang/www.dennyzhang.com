DevOps is all about integration. *Choosing the right weapons* is usually the most confusing part to normal people. Definitely it makes no sense to try everything.

[[color:#c7254e][Step1: Get Hottest DevOps Key Words]]
*Google* has done a wonderful job, providing us excellent learning materials. I deeply believe all developers have the rights to use google, even if you're in China. (See: [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/free_vpn][Free And Temporary VPN For China]].)

Choosing the right key words matters. Yes, we can simply google [[https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=devops+trends&oq=devops+trend][Devops Trend]]. hmm, just a bit general and fuzzy, right?

Let's try to answer this question first: where DevOpsers usually talk on the internet?

Here are my observations. (Please advise!)
1. *Reddit*. Reddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/devops][DevOps channel]] is my favorite. Whenever I ask a new question, I can always expect lots of deep input or feedbacks.
- *LinkedIn*. I see daily updates in below LinkedIn Groups: [[https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3726537][#DevOps Professionals]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2825397][#DevOps]] and [[https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6585254][#Devops (AWS, ...]]. Many updates are business related, marketing news or website promotion. Still we can find useful information from time to time.
- *Dzone*. I'm a frequent visitor for [[https://dzone.com/devops-tutorials-tools-news/list?sort=popular][DevOps Channel]] in DZone. People tend to talk a lot about DevOps methodologies there. It's my hornor to be recognized as one [[https://www.dennyzhang.com/dzone_mvb][MVP]] (Most Valuable Blogger) By DZone.com.
- *Google+*. Google plus doesn't have active DevOps groups. But I found below related groups are pretty hot: [[https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109254488709825102030][#Linux]].
- *Quora*. Not very active. Quora has [[https://www.quora.com/topic/DevOps][DevOps channel]]. Most questions are from DevOps beginners.
- *Twitter*. Personally I follow hundreds of DevOps influencers in Twitter. So far no strong recommendations yet. I maintain a twitter list: [[https://twitter.com/dennyzhang001/lists/devops-advocate][devops-advocate]]. Also I constantly check Twitter tag: [[https://twitter.com/hashtag/devops?src=hash][#devops]].
- *Medium*. [[https://medium.com/tag/devops][DevOps Tag]] provides materials with deep reading.
- *StackOverflow*: Hottest [[http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=devops][DevOps]] Questions.
- *InfoQ*. Check [[https://www.infoq.com/Devops/articles][#DevOps Channel]], if you're DevOps gurus.
- *Facebook*. Better skip. Very few DevOps discussions there.

Discuss with me in [[https://www.reddit.com/user/dennyzhang][Reddit]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennyzhang001][Linkedin]], [[https://twitter.com/dennyzhang001][Twitter]] or [[https://plus.google.com/110003543979899851370?rel=author][Google+]].

[[color:#c7254e][Step2: Find Your Favorite DevOps Blogs And Websites]]

There are many DevOps websites on the internet. *Unfortunately* most of them are of low traffic, or only updated occasionally. (DevOps gurus: Please share your preferences.)

If you're in a hurry, you can safely skip this. _any serious content publishers will re-post to above platforms_. You won't miss the pearls and jewels.

Here is the list of qualified and active DevOps websites. (Again, please advise)
- [[https://blog.serverdensity.com][blog.serverdensity.com]]: Lots of handy tips from their CEO and his excellent team.
- [[https://www.datadoghq.com/blog][datadoghq.com]]: Many in-depth monitoring tips.
- [[https://www.flux7.com][flux7.com]]: They have been talking about AWS stuff for years. Very informative.
- [[https://devops.com][devops.com]]: This one should be famous. Frankly speaking, I usually get lost browsing this website.
- [[http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com][devopsreactions]]: Cute gif pictures about DevOps in tumblr.

[[color:#c7254e][Step3: Subscribe To Your Favorite Mailing Lists]]
Mailing list is effortless. Here are my preference: [[http://www.devopsweekly.com][DEVOPS WEEKLY]], [[http://sreweekly.com][sreweekly]].

[[color:#c7254e][Step4: Talk To DevOps Experts You know]]

If you happen to know DevOps experts in person, talk with him/her for half an hour. You will have a much deeper understanding, compared to hours of reading on the internet.
